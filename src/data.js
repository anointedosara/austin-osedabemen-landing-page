    question: 'WHAT IS AFFILIATE MARKETING',
    answer: ['Affiliate marketing is a type of online marketing in which a business rewards an affiliate for each sale or conversion made by the affiliate’s marketing efforts. Affiliates promote the business’s products or services using a unique affiliate link or code, and when a customer clicks on the link and makes a purchase, the affiliate earns a commission on the sale.',
    'Affiliate marketing is a popular strategy for businesses looking to expand their online reach and boost sales, as it allows them to tap into the networks and audiences of other marketers and influencers. For affiliates, it can be a lucrative way to earn money online by promoting products or services they believe in to their own audience. It’s also relatively low-risk and low-cost, as affiliates don’t have to create their own products or handle customer service or fulfillment. Instead, they focus on driving traffic and conversions to the business’s website through various marketing channels, such as social media, email marketing, paid advertising, and content marketing.'],
